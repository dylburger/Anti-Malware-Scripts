-- About

Versions of this script have been used by the Grinnell College Helpdesk for
years. Many improvements were made by Evan Case and C.M. Lubinski. Dylan J.
Sather rewrote almost the entire script from scratch and made a number of
improvements

Together, these scripts make Anti-Malware software management simple. When
run properly, they keep the software up-to-date and help with the administration of this software.

These scripts currently run on Linux systems only. At the Grinnell College Helpdesk, this was ideal. For many normal users and many Helpdesks, it's probably not. A big TO-DO is making these scripts portable.

-- Files

There are two sets of files: the initial set of scripts you download, and the Anti-Malware files/logs in $DOWNLOAD_DIR, defined in downloadTools.sh :

  scripts/ : .antiMalwareFiles, .sedCommands, downloadTools.sh, moveUpdates.sh
  $DOWNLOAD_DIR/AntiMalware/ : [Anti-Malware files], download.log, error.history

-- Scripts

downloadTools.sh

  This script downloads the newest Anti-Malware files/updates to a specified directory. By default, this is set to '/tmp', but you can change this location by changing the value of $DOWNLOAD_DIR. Depending on the location, you may need to run this script with root privileges.

  Most of the URLs from which this script downloads updates are defined in a hidden file, .antiMalwareFiles. wget reads the URLS from this file in succession and logs errors if anything goes awry. Therefore, if you want to download any additional programs/updates, you should add them to .antiMalwareFiles

  Furthermore, all errors are e-mailed to $EMAIL. You'll need to add your e-mail address here if you'd like to receive error messages. These messages are also logged in $DOWNLOAD_DIR/AntiMalware/error.history . The servers are some mail providers will reject these poorly-formatted e-mails (see TO-DO)

-- TO-DO

There are many things still left to do, and many things that could help improve these scripts. If you have any ideas, please e-mail me at dylan.sather@gmail.com 

  - Port to Windows/Mac/other *nix/BSD systems
  - Condense error handling
  - wget seems to have internal error handling that allows it to download poorly-formatted/incorrect URLs; it may also be the target server that handles these errors and serves up what it believes to be the correct URL. While this behavior is great, it's puzzling. Further investigation is needed.
  - Some mail servers (i.e. Gmail) will not accept e-mails without the proper headers, and will thus reject the e-mails that these scripts send; eventually, these e-mails should be properly formatted and accepted by major mail providers
  - Add a web interface to easily view and change info
